# Task description
# You are given a string S consisting of N digits. What is the largest sum of two two-digit fragments of S? The selected fragments cannot overlap.
# Write a function:
# def solution(S)
# that, given a string S, returns the largest sum of two two-digit numbers that are non-overlapping fragments of S.
# Examples:
# 1. Given S = "43798", the function should return 141. The chosen fragments are "43" and "98": "43 7 98"
# 2. Given S = "00101", the function should return 10. The chosen fragments are "00" and "10": "00 10 1". Note that fragments "01" and "10" cannot be chosen as they overlap.
# 3. Given S = "0332331", the function should return 66. The chosen fragments are "33" and "33": "0 33 2 33 1".
# 4. Given S = "00331", the function should return 34. The chosen fragments are "03" and "31": "0 03 31"
# Assume that:
# N is an integer within the range [4..100];
# string S is made only of digits (0âˆ’9).



def solution(S):
    max_sum = 0
    n = len(S)

    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 2, n):
            fragment1 = int(S[i:i+2])
            fragment2 = int(S[j:j+2])

            if i + 2 <= j and fragment1 + fragment2 > max_sum:
                max_sum = fragment1 + fragment2

    return max_sum

# Test cases
print(solution("43798"))  # Should return 141
print(solution("00101"))  # Should return 10
print(solution("0332331"))  # Should return 66
print(solution("00331"))  # Should return 34
